# FriendFinder

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

There are 10 questions in the survey: each answer has to be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.


Here is the deployed app: https://herbinmorn-friendfinder.herokuapp.com/
